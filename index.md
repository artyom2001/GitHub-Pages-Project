## Hi everyone, my name is Artyom!
### I am a second year student at UCSD studying **Computer Engineering**.

One of my favorite quotes that *perfectly* describes programming is ***Hofstadter's Law***. It states that:

>It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.

Here are some of the programing languages that I have worked with so far:
- Java
- Python
- C/C++
- Javascript
- HTML/CSS

![Java](https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-128/java-60-1174953.png)![Python](https://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/cornmanthe3rd/plex/128/Other-python-icon.png) ![C++](https://bit.ly/31Lr1xp) 
![HTML/CSS/JS](https://i.ibb.co/6WXZstj/htmlcssjs.jpg)  

However, if I had to rank my top 3 favorite of these, they would be
1. C++
2. Python
3. Javascript

For some fun, here is the pseudocode for arguably the ~~best~~ worst sorting algorithm: **Bogosort**

```
while !isSorted(list):
    shuffle(list)
```

Also, here is a proof showing that [P = NP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&ab_channel=RickAstleyVEVO, "Proof"),

Tasks:
- [x] Fill out Team Survey
- [x] Finish Individual Engineer Statement
- [x] Lab 1: VSCode, Markdown and Git
- [ ] CSE 110 Project

Finally, here is a picture of a cute husky!
